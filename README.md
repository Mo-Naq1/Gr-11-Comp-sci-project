# Gr. 11 Indigenous Game Project

This was my Gr. 11 Comp Sci Project. I used Python in Processing. I significantly developed my understanding of Object Oriented Programming through this project. The game was based on the Indigenous creation story, "The Otter."

To try the game, you have to download the final_game folder and open Game.pyde in Processing. Make sure the language is set to Python. Make sure that you add the minim library in Processing.

To do this, open Processing, then click on Sketch → Import Library → Add library, and then earch for minim.
